# Matlab - Tips, Tricks and Code Snippets!
Sometimes you might not understand the documention or you get confused by it. Maybe you have some sort of "special needs" for you code, or want finished, working code examples. This repo should simply stuff. I want to share some code i've used as well to solve my issues. I hope some of this stuff will help you. Dont expect 10/10 code. It might not be the best solution and might have some flaws, tho if you know how to make it better, feel free to edit some of it. 

My experiences are almost 100% based on the new app designer.

## Why?
I love programming, and it comes with a lot of challenges that can be frustrating. Personally i love these challenges, and since i also love to help people, i thought why not sharing my experiences and help others too!
